[UNSD SDG API](https://github.com/MikePeleah/development-data-apis/tree/main/UNSD_SDGs) provides access to the dissemination platform of the Global SDG Indicators Database. This platform provides access to data compiled through the UN System in preparation for the Secretary-General's annual report on "Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals". Starting 2019, major updates are expected to be released in March, June/July, September and December. .

[The World Bank Indicators API](https://github.com/MikePeleah/development-data-apis/tree/main/WorldBank_WDI) provides access to nearly 16,000 time series indicators. Most of these indicators are available online through tools such as Databank and the Open Data website. The API provides programmatic access to this same data. Many data series date back over 50 years, and can be used to create interesting applications.
